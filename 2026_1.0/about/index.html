                            Working in long term care for more than 20 years, Robert has witnessed the predictable
                            patterns
                            of aging and frailty, as well as the injuries that are associated with aging. In 2015, he
                            began
                            his barbell journey as a way to improve his functional strength in his secondary profession
                            as a
                            paid-on-call firefighter. He soon saw the connection between weight training and improved
                            aging.
                            Dr. Jonathan Sullivan's work, "The Barbell Prescription" inspired him to become a
                            Barbell
                            Logic-trained coach.
